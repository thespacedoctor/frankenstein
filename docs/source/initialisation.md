# Initialisation 

Before using frankenstein you need to use the `init` command to generate a user settings file. Running the following creates a [yaml](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/) settings file in your home folder under `~/.config/frankenstein/frankenstein.yaml`:

```bash
frankenstein init
```

The file is initially populated with frankenstein's default settings which can be adjusted to your preference.

If at any point the user settings file becomes corrupted or you just want to start afresh, simply trash the `frankenstein.yaml` file and rerun `frankenstein init`.

<!-- Once created, open the settings file in any text editor and follow the in-file instructions to populate the missing settings values (usually given an ``XXX`` placeholder).  -->
